# Spring AI

This repository demonstrates how to integrate AI models, such as GPT-4, into a Spring Boot application, leveraging external data sources to enhance their functionality. The application highlights how to enrich prompts with real-time data using Google Books API and handle audio-based queries using AssemblyAI for transcription.

## Features

- **AI Integration with GPT-4**: Processes enriched prompts to generate intelligent and context-aware responses.
- **Audio Query Support**: Accepts audio files from users, transcribes them using AssemblyAI, and processes the query.
- **Prompt Enrichment**: Uses Google Books API to fetch the latest data, ensuring responses are up-to-date.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with Spring Boot, incorporating Spring Functions for modularity and reusability.
- **Flexible Design**: Abstracted services (`TranscriptService`, `ReasoningService`) ensure easy adaptability to other AI or transcription providers.

## Architecture Overview
![architecture.png](architecture.png)
1. **Audio Input**: Users submit an audio file containing their query.
2. **Transcription**: `TranscriptService` uses AssemblyAI to convert audio to text.
3. **Prompt Enrichment**: `fetchBooks` function fetches the latest book data from Google Books API.
4. **AI Response**: `ReasoningService` processes the enriched prompt using GPT-4 and generates a response.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Backend framework for building scalable applications.
- **Spring Functions**: Lightweight, reusable functions for focused tasks.
- **Google Books API**: Provides up-to-date book information.
- **AssemblyAI**: Handles audio transcription.
- **GPT-4**: Generates intelligent responses based on enriched prompts.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BartDro/SpringAi.git
   cd SpringAi
   ```

2. Configure API keys in `application.yaml` file:
   - Add OpenAi API key.
   - Add AssemblyAI API key.
   - Add Google Books API key.


3. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

## Usage

1. Send http request with audio prompt to the designated endpoint.
